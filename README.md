## What is Data Science ?
> **Data Science** is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on extracting knowledge from data sets which are typically huge in amount. The field encompasses analysis, preparing data for analysis, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in an organization.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

# Beginner Level ðŸ‘‡

## Descriptive Stats :
> To become a successful data scientist, you should have knowledge of Statistics. Statistics knowledge will give you the ability to **decide which algorithm is good for a certain problem**

### Now let's dive into python's libraries :
#### Notes I strongly recommend to study these libraries from  [This Book](https://eg1lib.org/book/11078294/7bcf98) , in case you aren't familiar with `reading` i will put some resources i hope it help! 
## Pandas
> **Pandas** is used for data cleaning and data preprocessing

## Numpy 
> **NumPy** is short for numerical Python and is one of Pythonâ€™s most important libraries it used for matrix and multidimensional array operations in Python
